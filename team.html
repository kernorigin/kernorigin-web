            <!-- FIRM APPROACH -->

                <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Our Approach</h3>
                <p>We're a boutique firm. No junior analysts. No PowerPoint factories. Just experienced partners who've seen enough dysfunction to recognize patterns instantly.</p>
                <p>When you work with Kernorigin, you get:</p>
                <ul style="line-height: 2;">
                    <li><strong>Direct partner access</strong> – No delegation to juniors. Partners do the work.</li>
                    <li><strong>25+ years of pattern recognition</strong> – Not textbook theory. Real experience across industries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Honest diagnosis</strong> – We tell you what's broken, not what you want to hear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeted interventions</strong> – No generic best practices. Custom solutions for your root cause.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation support</strong> – We don't just recommend. We stay until it sticks.</li>

            <!-- HISTORY - FIX #6 -->
            <div style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p><strong>Value Drive Consulting (2001-2019):</strong> Founded with international clients from day one. Built a reputation for surgical root cause diagnosis across education, manufacturing, and professional services. Worked quietly, produced results, earned trust.</p>
                <p><strong>Kernorigin (2019-Present):</strong> Rebranded to reflect our core methodology—finding the origin of institutional dysfunction. Same partners. Same diagnostic rigor. Expanded into technology systems and AI-powered analytics while maintaining focus on root cause problem-solving.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">We've been finding what's actually broken for 25 years. The name changed. The approach never did.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- WHY WE DO THIS -->
            <div style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
                <h3>Why We Do This</h3>
                <p>Most consultants sell solutions. We find root causes. Why?</p>
                <p>Because we've watched too many organizations waste money on band-aid solutions that don't stick. We've seen leadership teams exhaust themselves working harder when they should be working differently. We've seen potential squandered because the real problem was never diagnosed.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">That's wasteful. And we don't do wasteful work.</p>

                <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.9);">Since 2001, we've worked with clients across India, Southeast Asia, Middle East, North America, and Europe. Not because we chase geography, but because root cause problems are universal.</p>
                <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.9); margin-bottom: 0;">We take on a limited number of engagements per year. We're strategic partners, not vendors. We work with leadership teams who value diagnostic rigor over quick fixes.</p>
