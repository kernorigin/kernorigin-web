            <!-- OUR APPROACH -->
            <div class="approach-block">
                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>We're a boutique firm. No junior analysts. No PowerPoint factories. Just experienced partners who've seen enough dysfunction to recognise patterns instantly.</p>
                <p>When you work with Kernorigin, you get:</p>
                <ul style="line-height: 2;">
                    <li><strong>Direct partner access</strong> — No delegation to juniors. Partners do the work.</li>
                    <li><strong>25 years of pattern recognition</strong> — Not textbook theory. Real experience across industries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Honest diagnosis</strong> — We tell you what's broken, not what you want to hear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeted interventions</strong> — No generic best practices. Custom solutions for your root cause.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation support</strong> — We don't just recommend. We stay until it sticks.</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- OUR STORY -->
            <div class="prose-section">
                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p><strong>Value Drive Consulting (2001–2019):</strong> Founded with international clients from day one. Built a reputation for surgical root cause diagnosis across education, manufacturing, and professional services. Worked quietly, produced results, earned trust.</p>
                <p><strong>Kernorigin (2019–Present):</strong> Rebranded to reflect our core methodology — finding the origin of institutional dysfunction. Same partners. Same diagnostic rigor. Expanded into technology systems and AI-powered analytics while maintaining focus on root cause problem-solving.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">We've been finding what's actually broken for 25 years. The name changed. The approach never did.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- WHY WE DO THIS -->
            <div class="prose-section">
                <h3>Why We Do This</h3>
                <p>Most consultants sell solutions. We find root causes. Because we've watched too many organisations waste money on band-aid solutions that don't stick. We've seen leadership teams exhaust themselves working harder when they should be working differently. We've seen potential squandered because the real problem was never diagnosed.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">That's wasteful. And we don't do wasteful work.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- GLOBAL REACH -->
            <div class="global-card">
                <h3>Global Reach, Strategic Focus</h3>
                <p>Since 2001, we've worked with clients across India, Southeast Asia, Middle East, North America, and Europe. Not because we chase geography, but because root cause problems are universal.</p>
                <p>We take on a limited number of engagements per year. We're strategic partners, not vendors. We work with leadership teams who value diagnostic rigor over quick fixes.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">But we're not academics. We're practitioners who use frameworks to diagnose, not impress. Theory informs our work. Experience drives our recommendations.</p>
